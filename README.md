Description of the Employee Management System (GUI)

This project is a Java Swing-based GUI application for managing employee records. It replaces the original console-based system with an interactive interface, allowing users to perform key operations more intuitively.

Key Features:
Add Employee:

Users can enter employee details such as ID, name, position, contact, and salary through input fields.
Details are saved to a unique file corresponding to the employee's ID.
View Employee:

Users can input an employee ID to retrieve and display details stored in the corresponding file.
Data is shown in a read-only text area.
Remove Employee:

Users can remove an employee record by entering the employee's ID.
The file associated with the ID is deleted if it exists.
Update Employee:

Users can modify specific details of an employee by specifying the old and new values.
Changes are made directly in the file associated with the employee's ID.
Exit:

A button allows users to exit the application safely.
Technologies Used:
Java Swing: For GUI components like buttons, labels, text fields, and windows.
File Handling: To store, retrieve, update, and delete employee data in text files.
Event Handling: To handle button clicks and user inputs.
Purpose and Usage:
This project demonstrates core Java concepts like event-driven programming, file I/O operations, and object-oriented principles in a real-world application. It is a simple yet functional Employee Management System suitable for small-scale management tasks or educational purposes.
